# üíß Water Quality Prediction 

This project uses machine learning to predict water pollutant levels based on the **year** and **station ID**. It is built with Python and Streamlit and uses a trained model saved as `pollution_model.pkl`.

## Overview of this project

##  Problem Statement

Water pollution poses serious threats to public health, agriculture, and aquatic ecosystems. Monitoring water quality across different locations (stations) over time is essential. However, continuous monitoring is resource-intensive. This project aims to **predict water quality parameters** like Oxygen, Nitrate, etc., based on **Station ID** and **Year**, reducing dependency on frequent physical testing.
